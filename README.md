# IT Knowledge Base Automation System

## Overview
This project documents an internal IT documentation review and automation system designed to standardize how knowledge base content is submitted, reviewed, approved, and archived.

The system focuses on reducing manual processes, improving accountability, and creating a repeatable workflow for IT documentation.

---

## Problem
Before this system:
- Documentation updates were submitted manually
- There was no standardized review or approval process
- Notifications were handled inconsistently
- There was no clear audit trail for changes

---

## Solution
I designed and built a centralized automation platform that:
- Collects documentation submissions through a Power Apps interface
- Stores structured data using SharePoint Lists
- Uses Power Automate to route notifications and approvals
- Tracks documentation status from submission to archive

---

## Tools Used
- Power Apps (Canvas App)
- Power Automate
- SharePoint Lists
- Microsoft 365

---

## Why This Matters
This project demonstrates practical experience with:
- IT process automation
- Internal tooling design
- Workflow standardization
- Documentation governance
